I'm passionate about the participatory use of existing behavioral data in the design process of products and services. This is a research topic I call **Data-Centric Design**.

**Behavioral data** are data that map the behaviors of people and their environment. This includes sensor data such as in a smartwatch, logs of digital systems such as checking in/out at the train station, and self-logged data such as a diet application in which you would record what you eat.

I particularly look at **existing data** opportunities, that is, data already collected for or as a result of a product or service. There is already so much data generated everywhere; let's not add to environmental and privacy issues.

I believe in the [data humanism](https://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold) philosophy, which means I am looking at data beyond their numerical and quantitative value, recognizing the complexity of our world, and using data as a starting point that must be enriched with context.

I do so through a **participatory approach** as I believe people's data must be used by, with, and for people who generate it. This might be researchers with participants or users among themselves. I look for collaborations that could likely lead to reciprocal exchanges of values and reflexivity.

Thus, I develop **concepts, tools, and methods** to facilitate the participatory use of existing behavioral data.
